# Porting Plan: PureMVC AS3 State Machine Utility to TypeScript

1.  Analyze the AS3 codebase to understand the structure and functionality.
    *   Locate the main classes in the AS3 project.
    *   Identify dependencies between classes.
    *   Understand the flow of state transitions.
    *   Document key functionalities.
2.  Set up the TypeScript project with the necessary dependencies (PureMVC).
    *   Configure the new TypeScript project in the current folder
    *   Install the PureMVC TypeScript MultiCore framework.
    *   Configure the project with tsconfig.json, eslint
3.  Port the core state machine logic.
    *   Port the State class.
    *   Port the StateMachine class.
    *   Port any other core classes.
    *   Implement state transition logic.
4.  Address the FSMInjector with JSON/Zod implementation.
    *   Create a JSON schema for state machine definitions using Zod.
    *   Implement a class to read and validate JSON configurations.
    *   Implement the FSMInjector functionality using the JSON configuration and Zod schema.
5.  Write unit tests.
    *   Write unit tests for the core state machine logic.
    *   Write unit tests for the FSMInjector with JSON configuration.
    *   Ensure sufficient code coverage.
6. Documentation
    *   Create README with instructions on how to use the library.
    *   Document the API.
7.  Review and refine the ported code, tests, and documentation.
